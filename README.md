# Hello-World
A beginner’s project to learn GitHub basics creating branches, making commits, and opening pull requests.
Hello! This is my first GitHub repository.
I created this project as part of the GitHub "Hello World" exercise to learn the basics of using Git and GitHub.

In this repository, I’ll be practicing:

✨ Creating and managing branches

📝 Making commits with meaningful messages

🔄 Opening and reviewing pull requests

✅ Merging changes into the main branch

This is just the beginning of my journey into coding, version control, and open-source collaboration. 🚀
